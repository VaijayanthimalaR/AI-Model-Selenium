# 🔍 Flaky Test Detector with ML Integration

This project integrates a Machine Learning model with a Selenium Java framework to detect and flag flaky tests during execution.

## 📂 Structure
- `predict_flaky.py`: Python script to predict flaky test based on test duration.
- `LoginTest.java`: Java test that calls the ML script and flags flaky tests.
- `flaky_report.html`: Auto-generated report showing flaky test status.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed with necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
